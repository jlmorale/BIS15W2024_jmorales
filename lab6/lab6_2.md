## Learning Goals  
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Develop your dplyr superpowers so you can easily and confidently manipulate dataframes.  
2. Learn helpful new functions that are part of the `janitor` package.  

## Instructions
For the second part of lab today, we are going to spend time practicing the dplyr functions we have learned and add a few new ones. This lab doubles as your homework. Please complete the lab and push your final code to GitHub.  

## Load the libraries

```r
library("tidyverse")
```

```
## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
## ✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.4
## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1

```

```r
library("janitor")
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'janitor'
## 
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     chisq.test, fisher.test
```

## Load the superhero data
These are data taken from comic books and assembled by fans. The include a good mix of categorical and continuous data.  Data taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set  

Check out the way I am loading these data. If I know there are NAs, I can take care of them at the beginning. But, we should do this very cautiously. At times it is better to keep the original columns and data intact.  

```r
superhero_info <- read_csv("data/heroes_information.csv", na = c("", "-99", "-")) #we want to interpret nothing, -99, or a dash as a NA
```

```
## Rows: 734 Columns: 10
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (8): name, Gender, Eye color, Race, Hair color, Publisher, Skin color, A...
## dbl (2): Height, Weight
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

```r
superhero_powers <- read_csv("data/super_hero_powers.csv", na = c("", "-99", "-"))
```

```
## Rows: 667 Columns: 168
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr   (1): hero_names
## lgl (167): Agility, Accelerated Healing, Lantern Power Ring, Dimensional Awa...
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

## Data tidy
1. Some of the names used in the `superhero_info` data are problematic so you should rename them here. Before you do anything, first have a look at the names of the variables. You can use `rename()` or `clean_names()`.    


```r
superhero_info <- read_csv("data/heroes_information.csv", na = c("", "-99", "-")) %>% clean_names()
```

```
## Rows: 734 Columns: 10
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (8): name, Gender, Eye color, Race, Hair color, Publisher, Skin color, A...
## dbl (2): Height, Weight
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```


## `tabyl`
The `janitor` package has many awesome functions that we will explore. Here is its version of `table` which not only produces counts but also percentages. Very handy! Let's use it to explore the proportion of good guys and bad guys in the `superhero_info` data.  

```r
tabyl(superhero_info, alignment)
```

```
##  alignment   n     percent valid_percent
##        bad 207 0.282016349    0.28473177
##       good 496 0.675749319    0.68225585
##    neutral  24 0.032697548    0.03301238
##       <NA>   7 0.009536785            NA
```

1. Who are the publishers of the superheros? Show the proportion of superheros from each publisher. Which publisher has the highest number of superheros?  


```r
superhero_info %>% 
  select(publisher)
```

```
## # A tibble: 734 × 1
##    publisher        
##    <chr>            
##  1 Marvel Comics

## # ℹ 724 more rows
```


```r
table(superhero_info$publisher)
```

```

```

2. Notice that we have some neutral superheros! Who are they? List their names below.  


```r
superhero_info %>% 
  select(name, alignment) %>% 
  filter(alignment == "neutral")
```

```
## # A tibble: 24 × 2
##    name         alignment
##    <chr>        <chr>    
##  1 Bizarro      neutral  
##  2 Black Flash  neutral  
##  3 Captain Cold neutral  
##  4 Copycat      neutral  
##  5 Deadpool     neutral  
##  6 Deathstroke  neutral  
##  7 Etrigan      neutral  
##  8 Galactus     neutral  
##  9 Gladiator    neutral  
## 10 Indigo       neutral  
## # ℹ 14 more rows
```

## `superhero_info`
3. Let's say we are only interested in the variables name, alignment, and "race". How would you isolate these variables from `superhero_info`?


```r
superhero_info %>% 
  select(name, alignment, race)
```

```
## # A tibble: 734 × 3
##    name          alignment race             
##    <chr>         <chr>     <chr>            
##  1 A-Bomb        good      Human            
##  2 Abe Sapien    good      Icthyo Sapien    
##  3 Abin Sur      good      Ungaran          
##  4 Abomination   bad       Human / Radiation
##  5 Abraxas       bad       Cosmic Entity    
##  6 Absorbing Man bad       Human            
##  7 Adam Monroe   good      <NA>             
##  8 Adam Strange  good      Human            
##  9 Agent 13      good      <NA>             
## 10 Agent Bob     good      Human            
## # ℹ 724 more rows
```

## Not Human
4. List all of the superheros that are not human.


```r
superhero_info %>% 
  select(name, alignment, race) %>% 
  filter(race != "Human" & race != "Human / Radiation")
```

```
## # A tibble: 211 × 3
##    name         alignment race           
##    <chr>        <chr>     <chr>          
##  1 Abe Sapien   good      Icthyo Sapien  
##  2 Abin Sur     good      Ungaran        
##  3 Abraxas      bad       Cosmic Entity  
##  4 Ajax         bad       Cyborg         
##  5 Alien        bad       Xenomorph XX121
##  6 Amazo        bad       Android        
##  7 Angel        good      Vampire        
##  8 Angel Dust   good      Mutant         
##  9 Anti-Monitor bad       God / Eternal  
## 10 Anti-Venom   <NA>      Symbiote       
## # ℹ 201 more rows
```

## Good and Evil
5. Let's make two different data frames, one focused on the "good guys" and another focused on the "bad guys".

6. For the good guys, use the `tabyl` function to summarize their "race".

7. Among the good guys, Who are the Vampires?

8. Among the bad guys, who are the male humans over 200 inches in height?

9. Are there more good guys or bad guys with green hair?  

10. Let's explore who the really small superheros are. In the `superhero_info` data, which have a weight less than 50? Be sure to sort your results by weight lowest to highest.  

11. Let's make a new variable that is the ratio of height to weight. Call this variable `height_weight_ratio`.    

12. Who has the highest height to weight ratio?  

## `superhero_powers`
Have a quick look at the `superhero_powers` data frame.  

13. How many superheros have a combination of agility, stealth, super_strength, stamina?

## Your Favorite
14. Pick your favorite superhero and let's see their powers!  

15. Can you find your hero in the superhero_info data? Show their info!
