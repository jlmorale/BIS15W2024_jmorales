```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

### 1. Load the fish data 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
fish <- read.csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```

### 2. Transform the fish data to only inlcude variables lakeid and length. Store this as a new dataframe called "fishlength". 

```{r}
fish_length <- select(fish, "lakeid", "length") #remember select pulls out the variables or the columns 
```

### 3. Filter the fish data to include the samples from lake "BO" 

```{r}
filter(fish, lakeid == "BO") #filter pulls out the rows 
```

### 4. Calculate the mean length of fish from lake "BO". 

```{r}
fish_bo <- filter(fish, lakeid == "BO") #step 1: make it into a its own data frame
```

```{r}
mean(fish_bo$length) #step2: niw find the mean, finding the mean will most likely be a two step process 
```
