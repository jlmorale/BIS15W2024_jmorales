## Instructions
This homework is a bit less traditional this week. There are some errors in the code below. In addition add notes and titles to the code chunks that explains what the code chunk does. Use AI tools, notes from class, or any other resources to help fix the errors. Feel free to edit any plots to your preference. Don't forget to answer the two questions at the bottom. Upon completion, you should not have to '#' out any of the code chunks.

Push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.   

Again make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!

1. Load the data set. Use the 'clean_names()' function change the uppercase column names to lowercase.  

```r
blood_count <- read_csv("blood_count_dataset.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

```
## Rows: 417 Columns: 9
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (1): Gender
## dbl (8): Age, Hemoglobin, Platelet_Count, White_Blood_Cells, Red_Blood_Cells...
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

2. Take a look at the data. 
Error: misspelling of the word "glimpse()" function. 

```r
glimpse(blood_count)
```

```
## Rows: 417
## Columns: 9
## $ age               <dbl> 68, 25, 57, 28, 38, 47, 37, 30, 35, 22, 41, 34, 40, …
## $ gender            <chr> "Female", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Male", "Female"…
## $ hemoglobin        <dbl> 10.4, 13.8, 13.5, 12.7, 14.9, 12.0, 14.5, 11.8, 11.5…
## $ platelet_count    <dbl> 180000, 320000, 370000, 290000, 380000, 260000, 3800…
## $ white_blood_cells <dbl> 5700, 7500, 8500, 7800, 8700, 7000, 8700, 7000, 7100…
## $ red_blood_cells   <dbl> 3.7, 5.4, 5.1, 4.8, 5.7, 4.4, 5.7, 4.2, 4.2, 5.6, 4.…

```

3. Look for the min, max, and mean of the data by gender. 
Error: 
1. missing comma in line 44 
2. misspelling of "mean()"
3. missing parentheses 

```r
blood_count %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(min=min(red_blood_cells),
            mean=mean(red_blood_cells),
            max=max(red_blood_cells))
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 4
##   gender   min  mean   max
##   <chr>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
## 1 Female   3.6  4.36   4.9
## 2 Male     5    5.38   5.8
```


4. Find the means with the specified columns for males. The options function is used to remove the scientific notation for the rest of the session.
Error: 
1. Within the filter section there be an extra equal sign "=="
2. The capitalization of "male" and "gender" was not the same as in the data set
3. Using square brackets [] instead of parentheses () with the select function

```r
options(scipen = 999, digits = 2)

blood_count %>% 
  filter(gender=="Male") %>%
  select(3:9) %>%
  colMeans(na.rm = TRUE)
```

```
##        hemoglobin    platelet_count white_blood_cells   red_blood_cells 
##              14.0          355598.1            8184.7               5.4 
##               mcv               mch              mchc 
##              92.3              30.4              32.6
```


5. Find the means with the specified columns for females.
Error: 
1. Misspelling of data set 
1. Capitalization of "gender"
2. Missing the extra equal sign in the filter function
3. Unnecessary signs "/>%" 
4. Missing pipe in line 81
5.Using square brackets [] instead of parentheses () with the select function 

```r
blood_count %>% 
  filter(gender == "Female") %>% 
  select(3:9) %>%
  colMeans(na.rm = T)
```

```
##        hemoglobin    platelet_count white_blood_cells   red_blood_cells 
##              11.9          255913.5            6967.8               4.4 
##               mcv               mch              mchc 
##              84.9              27.7              32.2
```


6. Pivot the data longer and add a facet wrap comparing the blood count tests.  
Error: 
1. The data is already in a wider state so we would need to make the data longer. The cols function within the pivot_wider was formatted incorrectly.
2. Capitalization 
3. facet_wrap function was missing and the + sign to layer on the graph 

```r
blood_count %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = (3:9), 
               names_to = "test", 
               values_to = "values") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = test, y = values, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ test, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Blood Count Tests",
       x = "Test",
       y = "Values")
```

7. Categories the ages into individual groups. 
Error: 
1. change is not the correct function use mutate 
2. Capitalization 

```r
grouped_bc <- blood_count %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    age >= 20 & age <= 29 ~ "20s",
    age >= 30 & age <= 39 ~ "30s",
    age >= 40 & age <= 49 ~ "40s",
    age >= 50 & age <= 59 ~ "50s",
    age >= 60 & age <= 70 ~ "60s")) # there were only 4 people in 70s, so I combined it with 60s

head(grouped_bc)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 × 10
##     age gender hemoglobin platelet_count white_blood_cells red_blood_cells   mcv
##   <dbl> <chr>       <dbl>          <dbl>             <dbl>           <dbl> <dbl>
## 1    68 Female       10.4         180000              5700             3.7    77

## 5    38 Male         14.9         380000              8700             5.7    95
## 6    47 Female       12           260000              7000             4.4    87
## # ℹ 3 more variables: mch <dbl>, mchc <dbl>, age_group <chr>
```


8. Pivot the data longer and do a facet wrap 
Error: 
1. Capitalization 
2. Incorrect data set used to pipe 
3. misspelling of "aes"
4. missing "~" within the facet wrap function

```r
grouped_bc %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = (3:9), 
               names_to = "test", 
               values_to = "values") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = values, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ test, scales = "free") +  # Facet by the "Test" variable
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Blood Count Tests by Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Values")
```

9. What are two drawbacks and two benefits of AI?

A drawback of AI is that will not always help to fix the mistakes. It will give very good solutions but sometimes those solutions will not work. Another drawback is relying too much on AI once you figure out how to ask it very good questions. A benefit of AI is that it is a very good learning system. With chatGPT for example it will give you very good examples and steps as to what to do. 

10. Do you think you will use AI for coding in the future? Why or why not?

I think I will continue to use AI for coding in the future because again it is a very good resource to learn from.
